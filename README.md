# ML-Turbine-Energy-Yield-Prediction-for-Gas-Turbine-Optimization
This project uses machine learning to predict Turbine Energy Yield (TEY) from gas turbine data, optimizing settings to improve energy output, reduce fuel consumption, and cut costs. TEY predictions help detect deviations from normal operations, signaling potential turbine issues like degradation.
