# Turbine Energy Yield Prediction for Gas Turbine Optimization
This project uses machine learning to predict Turbine Energy Yield (TEY) from gas turbine data, optimizing settings to improve energy output, reduce fuel consumption, and cut costs. TEY predictions help detect deviations from normal operations, signaling potential turbine issues like degradation.

## Dataset Attribution
The dataset used in this project is from the Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission Data Set available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was collected from a gas turbine in Turkey's northwestern region, focusing on emissions and operational conditions.
